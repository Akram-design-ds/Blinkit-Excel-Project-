# Blinkit-Excel-Project-
I recently created an Excel dashboard to analyze Blinkitâ€™s sales performance and customer satisfaction, focusing on turning raw data into actionable insights.

**Key Challenges:**
- Analyzing the impact of fat content on sales and ratings.
- Identifying top-performing item types for inventory focus.
- Understanding how outlet age/type influences sales trends.

**Visualizations Used:**
- Donut charts for sales distribution by fat content.
- Bar charts for item type performance.
- Stacked columns for segmentation insights.
- Line charts for outlet performance over time.

**Key Learnings:**
- Fat content significantly affects sales and preferences.
- Certain products consistently outperform others, guiding inventory decisions.
- Older outlets show distinct purchasing patterns, aiding in forecasting.
- **Strategies:**
  - Enhance marketing for Tier 3 & medium-sized outlets.
  - Implement promotions for less popular items.
  - Develop loyalty programs for improved customer satisfaction.
